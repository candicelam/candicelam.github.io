       <p id="story-text">There are no 'right' or 'wrong' answers to any of these questions. The 'trolley problem' - first introduced by Philippa Food in 1967, was not designed to have a solution. It was created with the intent to provoke thought, and to acknowledge the difficulties of solving moral dilemmas.</p>
