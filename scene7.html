       <p id="story-text">You're standing on the bridge over a track as the runaway trolley approaches. Standing next to you, is a very large man, whose mass would surely stop the trolley. Do you push the man off the bridge, killing him to save 5 lives or do you do nothing, letting the 5 workers die.</p>
